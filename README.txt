DESCRIPTION

A library of functions useful for deriving consensus sequences for DNA or Amino
Acids.

Different thresholds can be specified for determining consensus, including
minimum count required, maximum error permitted, and minimum percentage 
required.

Inputs can be provided as a list of strings (sequences), a list of dictionaries 
(count of occurrences of pseudo-occurences), or a standard matrix (nucleotides/
amino acid positions in alphabetical order).

The produced consensus sequence can either be strict (one output per position),
or standard notation. DNA consensus sequences also have a redundant nucleotide
option.



REQUIREMENTS

This program runs in Python 2. It will not work properly with Python 3.

Please ensure you have Python 2 installed on your computer.

Please ensure you are using the correct version of Python to run this program.



INSTRUCTIONS

You don't need to know how to use git to use this program. You can simply open
"BioSeq_Consensus.py" in your online browser and copy it's contents onto a local 
file on your computer with the same name.

If you need this library to run another program, either paste a copy of
"BioSeq_Consensus.py" into the same folder as the ".py" file of that program, or
configure your Python runtime environment so that it is possible for said
program to access "BioSeq_Consensus.py".
